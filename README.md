## Introduction

Feedsomnia is designed to simplify the process of searching for used items across various classified ad websites. Instead of manually visiting each site, Feedsomnia automates the search, allowing you to monitor new ads in real-time and quickly find the best deals.

## The Problem

Manually searching multiple classified ad websites for specific items is time-consuming and inefficient. Users need a streamlined way to access all relevant listings in one place.

## The Solution

Feedsomnia consolidates classified ads from multiple websites into a single searchable platform. This automation allows you to:

- Monitor new ads in real-time.
- Search for items across multiple sites with a single query.
- Quickly contact sellers to secure the best deals.

## How It Works

Feedsomnia employs web scraping to collect data from various classified ad websites. This data is stored in a centralized database and queried based on user input. The user interface provides robust filtering options and displays ads in an organized, user-friendly format.

## Features

2. **Filter**: Select a country to filter results by location.
3. **View Results**: Browse the list of classified ads.
